## Assignment 7

Grant, this is a general description of the problem and it is within the scope of the course. I do want a bit more detail in your plans next week because you might be proposing somehting that is well too large for this project or too ambituous. So, I need to see a detailed plan next week with a narrower scoped idea to make sure you are going to be able complete things in a reasonable amount of time.
